<h1>Redouane's All Time Best Movies</h1>

<h2>The Top 3 of All-Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is my top-of-the-list Series so far; each episode I watch ignites my thirst for success</li>
        <li>My second reason for being in love with this piece of art is the British accent</li>
        <li>My third reason is a poem I heard Thomes Shelby recite: <em>"A Poison Tree"</em> by William Blake</li>
    </ol>
</p>   
<h4>Here are a few lines I never forget:</h4>
<p>
    I was angry with my friend; <br>
    I told my wrath, my wrath did end. <br>
    I was angry with my foe: <br>
    I told it not, my wrath did grow. <br>
</p>

<h3>2. Harry Potter</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unless I came across Peaky Blinders, Harry Potter would be my favourite in the list</li>
        <li>Harry Potter is my top movie series so far;</li>
        <li>if you ask me "how many time have you watch it?", I would say "YES!"</li>
        <li>Every time I watch it, it reminds me of my childhood experiences</li>
    </ul>
