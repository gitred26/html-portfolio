<p>My educational journey has been a thrilling expedition through the realms of academia. 
  It all began with my high school years, where I delved into the world of letters, 
  cultivating a love for language and literature.</p>

<P>After a quite difficult start in 2016, I embarked on my bachelor's degree in English Studies, specializing in Linguistics. 
  This period of study was foundational, laying the groundwork for my fascination with the intricacies of language and communication.</P>

<p>Eager to delve deeper into the field, in 2020 I pursued a Master's degree in Applied Linguistics, 
  where I explored the practical applications of linguistic theory in real-world contexts.</p>

<p>Building upon this foundation, I am currently pursuing a Master's in Business Administration (MBA), blending my linguistic expertise with business acumen.
  Also my other reasons for choosing to pursue an MBA came from my interest in building an IT business in the future.</p>

  crafting digital experiences that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

  I'm an avid jogger, finding solace and serenity in the rhythm of my footsteps. 
  Walking is another passion of mine, 
  offering the perfect opportunity to explore new surroundings and clear my mind.</p>

<p>In addition, I have a deep-seated love for Wing Chun, a martial art that 
  not only strengthens the body but also hones the mind and spirit.
